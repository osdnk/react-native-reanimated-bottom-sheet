## Usage
```javascript
import BottomSheet from 'reanimated-bottom-sheet'

class Example extends React.Component {
  renderInner = () => (
    /* render */
  );

  renderHeader = () => (
    /* render */
  )

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <BottomSheet
          snapPoints = {[450, 300, 0]}
          renderContent = {this.renderInner}
          renderHeader = {this.renderHeader}
        />

## Props

| name                      | required | default | description | 
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------|
| snapPoints                | yes      |         | E.g. `[300, 200, 0]`. Points for snapping of bottom sheet coomponent. They define distance from bottom of the screen. Might be number or percent (as string e.g. `'20%'`) for points or percents of screen height from bottom. |
| initialSnap               | no       |    0    | Determines initial snap point of bottom sheet. |
| renderContent             | no       |         | Method for rendering scrollable content of bottom sheet. |
| renderHeader              | no       |         | Method for rendering non-scrollable header of bottom sheet. |
| enabledGestureInteraction | no       | `true`  | Defines if bottom sheet could be scrollable by gesture. | 
| enabledManualSnapping     | no       | `true`  | If `false` blocks snapping using `snapTo` method. | 
| enabledInnerScrolling     | no       | `true`  | Defines whether it's possible to scroll inner content of bottom sheet.
| callbackNode              | no       |         | `reanimated` node which holds position of bottom sheet, where `1` it the highest snap point and `0` is the lowest.  


## Methods
### `snapTo(index)`
Imperative command for snapping to snap point in given index. E.g.

```javascript
this.bottomSheet.current.snaptTo(0)
```

## Example
Few more complicated examples could be found in `Example` folder which is simple Expo app

```javascript
cd Example
yarn
expo start
```

## Todo
It's not very finished and some work has to be done yet.
1. Play with magic config values
2. Horizontal mode
3. Deal with GH in inner scrollView
4. Cleanup code (e.g. measuring of components)
